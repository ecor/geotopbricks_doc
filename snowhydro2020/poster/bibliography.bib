abstract={ABSTRACT: Marked interannual fluctuations in rainfall are a fundamental aspect of southern African climate. This study uses dry spell frequency (DSF) to assess spatial and temporal patterns in the consistency of rainfall during the mid-summer (DJF) season and their relationships to interannual drought occurrences in southern Africa. The Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) pentad data are used to identify dry spells, which are defined here as a pentad with mean daily rainfall less than 1 mm. It was found that DSFs over most of southern Africa are highest (lowest) during El Ni{\~n}o (La Ni{\~n}a) events and that their occurrence is associated with shifts in the location of the tropical-temperate-trough (TTT) systems that are the dominant rain-producing systems over much of southern Africa. The latter are tropical-extratropical cloudbands that link a tropical low over low latitude southern Africa with a westerly disturbance passing south of the landmass. A preferred zone of occurrence of high DSFs, within which the interannual range is also highest, lies across the 20 to 25 deg band in southern Africa and is identified as the drought corridor. This region often experiences half or more of the season under dry spells. In addition, a tendency during 1979 to 2002 towards an increasing frequency of heavier rainfall events was observed over Angola/Namibia in the west and Tanzania/Mozambique in the east. Only a small area in central southern Africa showed the reverse tendency.},

abstract = {Abstract An earlier paper (Jolliffe IT, Sarria-Dodd DE. 1994. International Journal of Climatology 14: 71–76) investigated the problem of deciding when the wet season has started in tropical and sub-tropical climates. In particular, methodology based on linear discriminant analysis was developed for using data from the current season to make the decision, rather than relying only on information from previous seasons. It was shown, for three stations in eastern Africa, that the methodology was potentially valuable. The present study is much larger, using data from 24 stations, covering a range of annual rainfall totals, in western Africa. It is confirmed that linear discriminant analysis can indeed be useful in detecting when the wet season has started, and hence in deciding when to plant crops. As well as being a larger analysis than that reported previously, the present study also extends the previous work by investigating an alternative definition of the start of the wet season and by including ‘date’ as a potential explanatory variable.

We provide one here, a C procedure that provides Pr(Dn < d) with 13-15 digit accuracy for n ranging from 2 to at least 16000. We assess the (rather slow) approach to limiting form, and because computing time can become excessive for probabilities>.999 with n's of several thousand, we provide a quick approximation that gives accuracy to the 7th digit for such cases.},

Mean planetary values are examined and compared, over ocean, with information from recent satellite programs and related estimates, with generally positive agreements, but with some indication of small underestimates for GPCP over the global ocean. Variations during the satellite era in global precipitation are tied to ENSO events, with small increases during El Ninos, and very noticeable decreases after major volcanic eruptions. No overall significant trend is noted in the global precipitation mean value, unlike that for surface temperature and atmospheric water vapor. However, there is a pattern of positive and negative trends across the planet with increases over tropical oceans and decreases over some middle latitude regions. These observed patterns are a result of a combination of inter-decadal variations and the effect of the global warming during the period. The results reviewed here indicate the value of such analyses as GPCP and the possible improvement in the information as the record lengthens and as new, more sophisticated and more accurate observations are included.",

abstract = {Abstract Emphasizing the physical intricacies of integrated hydrology and feedbacks in simulating connected, variably saturated groundwater-surface water systems, the Integrated Hydrologic Model Intercomparison Project initiated a second phase (IH-MIP2), increasing the complexity of the benchmarks of the first phase. The models that took part in the intercomparison were ATS, Cast3M, CATHY, GEOtop, HydroGeoSphere, MIKE-SHE, and ParFlow. IH-MIP2 benchmarks included a tilted v-catchment with 3-D subsurface; a superslab case expanding the slab case of the first phase with an additional horizontal subsurface heterogeneity; and the Borden field rainfall-runoff experiment. The analyses encompassed time series of saturated, unsaturated, and ponded storages, as well as discharge. Vertical cross sections and profiles were also inspected in the superslab and Borden benchmarks. An analysis of agreement was performed including systematic and unsystematic deviations between the different models. Results show generally good agreement between the different models, which lends confidence in the fundamental physical and numerical implementation of the governing equations in the different models. Differences can be attributed to the varying level of detail in the mathematical and numerical representation or in the parameterization of physical processes, in particular with regard to ponded storage and friction slope in the calculation of overland flow. These differences may become important for specific applications such as detailed inundation modeling or when strong inhomogeneities are present in the simulation domain.},

abstract="Climate change scenarios with a high spatial and temporal resolution are required in the evaluation of the effects of climate change on agricultural potential and agricultural risk. Such scenarios should reproduce changes in mean weather characteristics as well as incorporate the changes in climate variability indicated by the global climate model (GCM) used. Recent work on the sensitivity of crop models and climatic extremes has clearly demonstrated that changes in variability can have more profound effects on crop yield and on the probability of extreme weather events than simple changes in the mean values. The construction of climate change scenarios based on spatial regression downscaling and on the use of a local stochastic weather generator is described. Regression downscaling translated the coarse resolution GCM grid-box predictions of climate change to site-specific values. These values were then used to perturb the parameters of the stochastic weather generator in order to simulate site-specific daily weather data. This approach permits the incorporation of changes in the mean and variability of climate in a consistent and computationally inexpensive way. The stochastic weather generator used in this study, LARS-WG, has been validated across Europe and has been shown to perform well in the simulation of different weather statistics, including those climatic extremes relevant to agriculture. The importance of downscaling and the incorporation of climate variability are demonstrated at two European sites where climate change scenarios were constructed using the UK Met.

abstract="Spatial autocorrelation is a correlation between the values of a single variable, considering their geographical locations. This concept has successfully been used for multi-site generation of daily precipitation data (Khalili et al. in J Hydrometeorol 8(3):396--412, 2007). This paper presents an extension of this approach. It aims firstly to obtain an accurate reproduction of the spatial intermittence property in synthetic precipitation amounts, and then to extend the multi-site approach to the generation of daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature and solar radiation data. Monthly spatial exponential functions have been developed for each weather station according to the spatial dependence of the occurrence processes over the watershed, in order to fulfill the spatial intermittence condition in the synthetic time series of precipitation amounts. As was the case for the precipitation processes, the multi-site generation of daily maximum temperature, minimum temperature and solar radiation data is realized using spatially autocorrelated random numbers. These random numbers are incorporated into the weakly stationary generating process, as with the Richardson weather generator, and with no modifications made. Suitable spatial autocorrelations of random numbers allow the reproduction of the observed daily spatial autocorrelations and monthly interstation correlations. The Peribonca River Basin watershed is used to test the performance of the proposed approaches. Results indicate that the spatial exponential functions succeeded in reproducing an accurate spatial intermittence in the synthetic precipitation amounts. The multi-site generation approach was successfully applied for the weather data, which were adequately generated, while maintaining efficient daily spatial autocorrelations and monthly interstation correlations.",

	Abstract = {We investigated the effect of two different spatial scales of climate change scenarios on crop yields simulated by the EPIC crop model for corn, soybean, and wheat, in the central Great Plains of the United States. The effect of climate change alone was investigated in Part I. In Part II (Easterling et al., 2001) we considered the effects ofCO2 fertilization effects and adaptation in addition to climate change. The scenarios were formed from five years of control and 2 ‚{\`a}{\"o}√≥CO2 runs of a high resolution regional climate model (RegCM) and the same from an Australian coarse resolution general circulation model (GCM), which provided the initial and lateral boundary conditions for the regional model runs. We also investigated the effect of two different spatial resolutions of soil input parameters to the crop models. We found that for corn and soybean in the eastern part of the study area, significantly different mean yield changes were calculated depending on the scenario used. Changes in simulated dryland wheat yields in the western areas were very similar, regardless of the scale of the scenario. The spatial scale of soils had a strong effect on the spatial variance and pattern of yields across the study area, but less effect on the mean aggregated yields. We investigated what aspects of the differences in the scenarios were most important for explaining the different simulated yield responses. For instance, precipitation changes in June were most important for corn and soybean in the eastern CSIRO grid boxes. We establish the spatial scale of climate changescenarios as an important uncertainty for climate change impacts analysis.},

@article{Serinaldi2009,
	Abstract = {This work describes a simple and parsimonious multisite Markov model deduced from bivariate copula-based mixed distributions useful for modeling and generating daily rainfall series. The structure of the model (involving only joint probabilities of wet/dry condition, a copula, the distribution of positive rainfall values, and a spatial cross-correlation matrix) allows preserving spatial and temporal intermittency and several other properties of hydrologic interest (e.g., wet spell length, daily rainfall amount, rainfall accumulated on wet spells, first steps of the autocorrelation function, and spatial Kendall's correlation coefficient). The model does not require marginal transformations of the observed values, and non-Gaussian temporal structures of dependence can be introduced by copulas. The spatial dependence is accounted for by simulating temporally independent but spatially correlated standard uniform random sequences. Application to observed rainfall time series and Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to assess the model performances. The approach appears to be a viable way to simulate daily rainfall sequences in a fairly easy way.},

@article{Yeboah2011,
	Abstract = {A daily rainfall disaggregation model, which uses a copula to model the dependence structure between total depth, total duration of wet periods, and the maximum proportional depth of a wet period, is presented. The wet(1)-dry(0) binary sequence is modeled by the nonrandomized Bartlett-Lewis model with diurnal effect incorporated before superimposing the AR(1) depth process submodel. Unlike previous studies, the model is structured such that all wet day data available are considered in the analysis, without the need to discard any good quality daily data embedded in a month having some missing data. This increased the data size, thus improving the modeling process. Further, the daily data are classified according to the total duration of wet periods duration within the day. In this way a large proportion of the model parameters become seasonal invariant, the overriding factor being the total duration of wet periods. The potential of the developed model has been demonstrated by disaggregating both the data set used in developing the model parameters and also a 12 year continuous rainfall data set not used in the model parameterization. Gross rainfall statistics of several aggregation levels down to 6 min have been very well reproduced by the disaggregation model. The copula dependence structure and the variation of the depth process submodel parameters with the total duration of wet periods are also very well captured by the presented model.},

During recent years a hybrid model has been set up for the operational forecasting of flood discharges in the 6750km2 Tyrolean part of the River Inn catchment in Austria. The catchment can be characterized as a typical alpine area with large variations in altitude. The paper is focused on the error analysis of discharge forecasts of four main tributary catchments simulated with hydrological water balance models. The selected catchments cover an area of 2230km2, where the non-glaciated and glaciated parts are modeled using the semi-distributed HQsim and the distributed model SES, respectively. The forecast errors are evaluated as a function of forecast lead time and forecasted discharge magnitude using 14 events from 2007 to 2010. The observed and forecasted precipitation inputs were obtained under operational conditions. The mean relative bias of the forecasted discharges revealed to be constant with regard to the forecast lead time, varying between 0.2 and 0.25 for the different catchments. The errors as a function of the forecasted discharge magnitude showed large errors at lower values of the forecast hydrographs, where errors decreased significantly at larger discharges being relevant in flood forecasting."

	Abstract = {In this paper, the authors explain the notion of long memory and report their results concerned with the long memory properties of trading volume and the volatility of stock returns (given by absolute returns and alternatively by square returns) of American companies listed in DJIA index. The contributors focus on calculation of long memory parameters and try to answer the question of whether or not the degree of long memory is the same for the trading volume and for the return volatility data and whether these are fractionally cointegrated. Computations are performed on a daily basis for the whole period from January 1990 to November 2005 and in four sub-periods: January 1990 to December 1993, January 1994 to December 1997, January 1998 to December 2001 and January 2002 to November 2005. We established that for the equities listed in the DJIA index the log-volume (the logarithm of trading volume) and returns volatility exhibit long memory. Moreover, these two series have the same long-memory parameters for most of the equities. This common long memory of both series is especially strongly pronounced in the latest data. On the other hand, there is no evidence that log-volume and volatility share the same long memory component. One important question which arises here concerns the source of long memory in the series. The existence of long memory in the series under investigation may reflect the statistical properties of fundamental factors underlying their behaviour or qualitative changes which take place on stock markets. According to empirical investigations, the growing share of stocks by institutional investors is accompanied by an increasing autocorrelation in returns and trading volume data. On the other hand, long memory is related to autocorrelation. Thus, in our opinion the increasing presence of long memory in the latest American trading-volume data may be caused by the growing share of equities by institutional investors.},

abstract = {We propose a semiparametric multivariate weather generator with greater ability to reproduce the historical statistics, especially the wet and dry spells. The proposed approach has two steps: (1) a Markov Chain for generating the precipitation state (i.e., no rain, rain, or heavy rain), and (2) a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) bootstrap resampler for generating the multivariate weather variables. The Markov Chain captures the spell statistics while the k-NN bootstrap captures the distributional and lag-dependence statistics of the weather variables. Traditional k-NN generators tend to under-simulate the wet and dry spells that are keys to watershed and agricultural modeling for water planning and management; hence the motivation for this research. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach and its improvement over the traditional k-NN approach through an application to daily weather data from Pergamino in the Pampas region of Argentina. We show the applicability of the proposed framework in simulating weather scenarios conditional on the seasonal climate forecast and also at multiple sites in the Pampas region.},

	Abstract = {A methodology for spatial-temporal disaggregation of rainfall is proposed. The methodology involves the combination of several univariate and multivariate rainfall models operating at different timescales, in a disaggregation framework that can appropriately modify outputs of finer timescale models so as to become consistent with given coarser timescale series. Potential hydrologic applications include enhancement of historical data series and generation of simulated data series. Specifically, the methodology can be applied to derive spatially consistent hourly rainfall series in rain gages where only daily data are available. In addition, in a simulation framework the methodology provides a way to take simulations of multivariate daily rainfall (incorporating spatial and temporal nonstationarity) and generate multivariate fields at fine temporal resolution. The methodology is tested via a case study dealing with the disaggregation of daily historical data of five rain gages into hourly series. Comparisons show that the methodology results in good preservation of important properties of the hourly rainfall process such as marginal moments, temporal and spatial correlations, and proportions and lengths of dry intervals as well as a good reproduction of the actual hyetographs.},

	Abstract = {Precipitation downscaling improves the coarse resolution and poor representation of precipitation in global climate models and helps end users to assess the likely hydrological impacts of climate change. This paper integrates perspectives from meteorologists, climatologists, statisticians, and hydrologists to identify generic end user (in particular, impact modeler) needs and to discuss downscaling capabilities and gaps. End users need a reliable representation of precipitation intensities and temporal and spatial variability, as well as physical consistency, independent of region and season. In addition to presenting dynamical downscaling, we review perfect prognosis statistical downscaling, model output statistics, and weather generators, focusing on recent developments to improve the representation of space-time variability. Furthermore, evaluation techniques to assess downscaling skill are presented. Downscaling adds considerable value to projections from global climate models. Remaining gaps are uncertainties arising from sparse data; representation of extreme summer precipitation, subdaily precipitation, and full precipitation fields on fine scales; capturing changes in small-scale processes and their feedback on large scales; and errors inherited from the driving global climate model.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, the authors explain the notion of long memory and report their results concerned with the long memory properties of trading volume and the volatility of stock returns (given by absolute returns and alternatively by square returns) of American companies listed in DJIA index. The contributors focus on calculation of long memory parameters and try to answer the question of whether or not the degree of long memory is the same for the trading volume and for the return volatility data and whether these are fractionally cointegrated. Computations are performed on a daily basis for the whole period from January 1990 to November 2005 and in four sub-periods: January 1990 to December 1993, January 1994 to December 1997, January 1998 to December 2001 and January 2002 to November 2005. We established that for the equities listed in the DJIA index the log-volume (the logarithm of trading volume) and returns volatility exhibit long memory. Moreover, these two series have the same long-memory parameters for most of the equities. This common long memory of both series is especially strongly pronounced in the latest data. On the other hand, there is no evidence that log-volume and volatility share the same long memory component. One important question which arises here concerns the source of long memory in the series. The existence of long memory in the series under investigation may reflect the statistical properties of fundamental factors underlying their behaviour or qualitative changes which take place on stock markets. According to empirical investigations, the growing share of stocks by institutional investors is accompanied by an increasing autocorrelation in returns and trading volume data. On the other hand, long memory is related to autocorrelation. Thus, in our opinion the increasing presence of long memory in the latest American trading-volume data may be caused by the growing share of equities by institutional investors.},

@article{Wilks1999,
	Abstract = {This article reviews the historical development of statistical weather models, from simple analyses of runs of consecutive rainy and dry days at single sites, through to multisite models of daily precipitation. Weather generators have been used extensively in water engineering design and in agricultural, ecosystem and hydrological impact studies as a means of in-filling missing data or for producing indefinitely long synthetic weather series from finite station records. We begin by describing the statistical properties of the rainfall occurrence and amount processes which are necessary precursors to the simulation of other (dependent) meteorological variables. The relationship between these daily weather models and lower-frequency variations in climate statistics is considered next, noting that conventional weather generator techniques often fail to capture wholly interannual variability. Possible solutions to this deficiency - such as the use of mixtures of slowly and rapidly varying conditioning variables - are discussed. Common applications of weather generators are then described. These include the modelling of climate-sensitive systems, the simulation of missing weather data and statistical downscaling of regional climate change scenarios. Finally, we conclude by considering ongoing advances in the simulation of spatially correlated weather series at multiple sites, the downscaling of interannual climate variability and the scope for using nonparametric techniques to synthesize weather series.},

abstract="Climate change is a global phenomenon but its implications are distinctively local. The climatic variables include temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, cloud coverage, and bright sunshine. The study of behavior of the climatic variables is very important for understanding the future changes among the climatic variables and implementing important policies. The problem is how to study the past, present, and future behaviors of the climatic variables. The purpose of the present study was to develop an appropriate vector autoregression (VAR) model for forecasting monthly temperature, humidity, and cloud coverage of Rajshahi district in Bangladesh. The test for stationarity of the time series variables has been confirmed with augmented Dickey--Fuller, Phillips--Perron, and Kwiatkowski--Phillips--Schmidt--Shin tests. The endogenity among the variables was examined by F-statistic proposed by C.W.J. Granger. The order of the VAR model was selected using Akaike information criterion, Schwarz information criteria, Hannan--Quinn information criteria, final prediction error, and likelihood ratio test. The ordinary least square method was used to estimate the parameters of the model. The VAR(8) model was found to be the best. Structural analyses were performed using forecast error variance decomposition and impulse response function. These structural analyses divulged that the temperature, humidity, and cloud coverage would be interrelated and endogenous in future. Finally, temperature, humidity, and cloud coverage were forecasted from January 2011 to December 2016 using the best selected model VAR(8). The forecasted values showed an upward trend in temperature and humidity and downward trend in cloud coverage. Therefore, we must show our friendly behavior to the environment to control such trends.",

	Abstract = {Given a symmetric matrix, what is the nearest correlation matrix---that is, the nearest symmetric positive semidefinite matrix with unit diagonal? This problem arises in the finance industry, where the correlations are between stocks. For distance measured in two weighted Frobenius norms we characterize the solution using convex analysis. We show how the modified alternating projections method can be used to compute the solution for the more commonly used of the weighted Frobenius norms. In the finance application the original matrix has many zero or negative eigenvalues; we show that for a certain class of weights the nearest correlation matrix has correspondingly many zero eigenvalues and that this fact can be exploited in the computation.},

The distribution is applied to the frequency analysis of floods, annual flows, and monthly flows, and a comparison with other commonly used methods suggests that it can be successfully used for this purpose. A procedure for its application has been suggested using only the median, the mean, and the standard deviation of the original data. The Gumbel distribution is a special case, and any straight line on the Gumbel probability paper can be transformed into a straight line on the lognormal probability paper by the 3-parameter lognormal distribution. The sample of 10 stations used in this study all exhibited negative skewness for the logarithms of the data and therefore the lognormal distribution that assumes this skewness equal to zero has generally given high estimates.},

The impact varies depending on the geo-localization of the studied region and its microclimate. The objective of this study is to further understand the impact of climate change on grapevine phenology by studying the role of varieties and microclimates through a regional assessment carried out in two future periods of time (2021–2050 and 2071–2099). The influence of altitude on phenological stages was studied on five different phenophases for five grapevine varieties in the province of Trento (Italian Alps). The model predicts a significant advance for all phenological stages (advanced harvest up to four weeks), which could affect the quality and suitability of the region for the selected varieties. In particular, the model indicates shorter phenophases and a shorter time between bud break and harvest, from one to three weeks. Furthermore, projected phenological changes are not homogeneous in the region under study: more pronounced effects of the temperature increase are expected at higher altitudes. Indeed, phenological advance is more pronounced for varieties grown at higher altitudes. On the contrary, phase duration and growing season length are more affected on the varieties grown at lower altitudes. A lower spread of harvest timing is expected in altitudinal transects, up to 3 days for every 100 m. We can conclude that adaptation strategies such as change of varieties, harvest management and wine making technologies will be necessary to cope with the effect of climate change."

abstract="Temperate deciduous trees can only be productive where winters are cold enough to meet their chilling needs. In the Mediterranean region, chill has traditionally been sufficient for many species, but this may change as temperatures increase. We explored the region's present and future suitability for temperate trees by quantifying chill for the Sfax region in central Tunisia, one of the warmest regions where temperate nuts are commercially grown. We assessed climatic risk by calculating historic chill (since 1973) and using a weather generator calibrated with local weather data (1973--2015) to produce 101 years of chill estimates (computed with the Dynamic Model) and 3 past and 72 future scenarios (for 2041--2070 and 2071--2100, using two representative concentration pathways: RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). For almonds and pistachios, we compared available chill during the chilling period with the species' estimated chilling requirements, and we computed the date by which sufficient chill was expected to have accumulated. Our findings indicated severe chill losses for all future scenarios. For all species, the current chill period is no longer expected to be sufficient for meeting chilling requirements in the future. Chill needs may still be fulfilled later in the year, especially for low-chill almonds, but this would result in delayed phenology, with possible adverse effects on productivity. Temperate nut production is thus unlikely to remain viable at this site, highlighting an urgent need to identify locally appropriate adaptation options. This challenge is likely shared by other warm production regions of temperate fruits and nuts around the world.",

The results show the following: (1) All four models produced reasonable results in terms of annual, monthly and daily rainfall occurrence and amount, as well as daily extreme, multi-day extremes and dry/wet spell length. However, they also simulated a large range of variability, which not only demonstrates the advantages of multiple weather generators rather than a single model but also is more suitable for climate change and variability impact studies. (2) Every model has its own advantages and disadvantages due to their different theories and principles. This enhances the benefits of using multiple models. (3) The models can be further calibrated/improved to have a ``better'' performance in comparison with observations. However, it was chosen not to do so in this case study for two reasons: to obtain a full range of climate variability and to acknowledge the uncertainties associated with observation data. The latter are interpolated from limited stations and therefore have high pairwise correlations---ranging from 0.69 to 0.99 with a median and mean value of 0.87 and 0.88, respectively, for daily rainfall. These conclusions were drawn from a case study in Australia, but could be extended to general guidelines of using weather generators for climate change and variability studies.",

We present the application of a parametric stochastic weather generator within a nonstationary context, enabling simulations of weather sequences conditioned on interannual and multi-decadal trends. The generalized linear model framework of the weather generator allows any number of covariates to be included, such as large-scale climate indices, local climate information, seasonal precipitation and temperature, among others. Here we focus on the Salado A basin of the Argentine Pampas as a case study, but the methodology is portable to any region. We include domain-averaged (e.g., areal) seasonal total precipitation and mean maximum and minimum temperatures as covariates for conditional simulation. Areal covariates are motivated by a principal component analysis that indicates the seasonal spatial average is the dominant mode of variability across the domain. We find this modification to be effective in capturing the nonstationarity prevalent in interseasonal precipitation and temperature data. We further illustrate the ability of this weather generator to act as a spatiotemporal downscaler of seasonal forecasts and multidecadal projections, both of which are generally of coarse resolution."

The proposed models account for hysteresis at multiple time scales, with particular attention given to systematic shifts in sediment transport following large floods (long-term hysteresis). A series of nested formulations are tested to evaluate the elements embedded in the proposed models in a case study watershed that supplies drinking water to New York City. To maximize available data for model development, a dynamic regression model is used to estimate SSC based on denser records of turbidity, where the parameters of this regression are allowed to vary over time to account for potential changes in the turbidity-SSC relationship. After validating the proposed rating curves, we compare simulations of SSC among a subset of models in a climate change impact assessment using an ensemble of flow simulations generated using a stochastic weather generator and hydrologic model. We also examine SSC estimates under synthetic floods generated using a peaks-over-threshold model. Our results indicate that estimates of extreme SSC under new climate and hydrologic scenarios can vary widely depending on the selected model and may be significantly underestimated if long-term hysteresis is ignored when simulating impacts under sequences of large storm event. Based on the climate change scenarios explored here, average annual maximum SSC could increase by as much as 2.45 times over historical values.},

abstract={Seasonal and inter-annual climate variability have become important issues for farmers, and climate change has been shown to increase them. Simultaneously farmers and agricultural organizations are increasingly collecting observational data about in situ crop performance. Agriculture thus needs new tools to cope with changing environmental conditions and to take advantage of these data. Data mining techniques make it possible to extract embedded knowledge associated with farmer experiences from these large observational datasets in order to identify best practices for adapting to climate variability. We introduce new approaches through a case study on irrigated and rainfed rice in Colombia. Preexisting observational datasets of commercial harvest records were combined with in situ daily weather series. Using Conditional Inference Forest and clustering techniques, we assessed the relationships between climatic factors and crop yield variability at the local scale for specific cultivars and growth stages. The analysis showed clear relationships in the various location-cultivar combinations, with climatic factors explaining 6 to 46\% of spatiotemporal variability in yield, and with crop responses to weather being non-linear and cultivar-specific. Climatic factors affected cultivars differently during each stage of development. For instance, one cultivar was affected by high nighttime temperatures in the reproductive stage but responded positively to accumulated solar radiation during the ripening stage. Another was affected by high nighttime temperatures during both the vegetative and reproductive stages. Clustering of the weather patterns corresponding to individual cropping events revealed different groups of weather patterns for irrigated and rainfed systems with contrasting yield levels. Best-suited cultivars were identified for some weather patterns, making weather-site-specific recommendations possible. This study illustrates the potential of data mining for adding value to existing observational data in agriculture by allowing embedded knowledge to be quickly leveraged. It generates site-specific information on cultivar response to climatic factors and supports on-farm management decisions for adaptation to climate variability.},

abstract = {In this study, we analyze satellite-based daily rainfall observations to compare and contrast the wet and dry spell characteristics of tropical rainfall. Defining a wet (dry) spell as the number of consecutive rainy (nonrainy) days, we find that the distributions of wet spells appear to exhibit universality in the following sense. While both ocean and land regions with high seasonal rainfall accumulation (humid regions; e.g., India, Amazon, Pacific Ocean) show a predominance of 2–4 day wet spells, those regions with low seasonal rainfall accumulation (arid regions; e.g., South Atlantic, South Australia) exhibit a wet spell duration distribution that is essentially exponential in nature, with a peak at 1 day. The behavior that we observed for wet spells is reversed for the dry spell characteristics. In other words, the main contribution to the dry part of the season, in terms of the number of nonrainy days, appears to come from 3–4 day dry spells in the arid regions, as opposed to 1 day dry spells in the humid regions. The total rainfall accumulated in each wet spell has also been analyzed, and we find that the major contribution to seasonal rainfall for arid regions comes from 1–5 day wet spells; however, for humid regions, this contribution comes from wet spells of duration as long as 30 days. We also explore the role of chance as well as the influence of organized convection in determining some of the observed features.},

abstract = "Accurate estimates of monsoonal rainfall at daily time scales are essential inputs for various water-related sectors such as drought and flood forecasting, crop and water management for agriculture. To serve this purpose, a variety of rainfall products, especially the gauge based products which serve as the ground-truth for other derived rainfall products, are available over India. In this study, three different daily gauge based gridded rainfall datasets, namely Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of water resources (APHRODITE) and Climate Prediction Center (CPC) unified rain gauge data are compared over India for the monsoon season of 1979–2007. The comparison among the datasets is based on the duration, frequency and intensity of three different spell characteristics, namely dry, wet and extreme wet spells, and their associated trends. Wet (dry) spells are defined as the consecutive period of wet (dry) days, where a wet (dry) day is defined using rainfall threshold of 1mm. Extreme wet spells are defined using the 90th percentile of rainfall above the depth of wet day. All datasets capture the spatial distribution of precipitation characteristics, albeit with pronounced differences at heavy rainfall regions. CPC and IMD show a close match in spell characteristics while APHRODITE significantly deviates. APHRODITE shows increased intensity of rainfall during dry periods, leading to over-estimation of wet days and under-estimation of dry days. Northern extreme of India (Jammu and Kashmir) show major differences in replicating the spell characteristics. Trend patterns are also not consistent between the three datasets. The present study will provide information on the spatio-temporal pattern of dry, wet and extreme wet spell characteristics over India and aid in selecting appropriate datasets for studying the Indian monsoon rainfall depending on their scope and application of research."

abstract = "Agricultural productivity in South Africa is negatively affected by drought as a result of frequent periodic dry spells and increasing crop water demands resulting in poor crop development and low yields. Thus, we embarked on this study which aims at investigating dry spell occurrences in relation to growing season of maize in the Luvuvhu River Catchment. Daily rainfall data (1945–2014) from 12 stations which represent the catchment fairly well was utilized in this study. Three consecutive planting dates were staggered based on three consecutive onsets of the rainy season. Dry spells were categorized into three groups: short, medium and long dry spells. The data was then subjected to theoretical distribution fitting using the Anderson–Darling goodness-of-fit test; and probabilities of occurrence were computed using a probabilistic model that best fits the data. Trend analysis was performed on the frequency of dry spells per growing period using the non-parametric Spearman's rank correlation test. Out results indicated high probabilities (≥80%) of short dry spells at all the stations irrespective of the timing of planting. Further analysis revealed that a risk of yield reduction with planting following the first onset of rains was higher than that with planting following the second and third onsets. In order to minimize this risk, farmers can be advised to plant between mid-November to mid-December. Trend analysis indicated no trend for all the various dry spell lengths except for Thohoyandou with a decreasing trend and Sigonde with a weak increasing trend in long dry spells. Such findings can be used to describe drought conditions for improvement of agricultural productivity and food security, in a given area."

Five of the leading statistics are examined—those often labelled D, W 2, V, U 2, A 2—and three important situations: where the hypothesized distribution F(x) is completely specified and where F(x) represents the normal or exponential distribution with one or more parameters to be estimated from the data. EDF statistics are easily calculated, and the tests require only one line of significance points for each situation. They are also shown to be competitive in terms of power. }

abstract={ABSTRACT: Marked interannual fluctuations in rainfall are a fundamental aspect of southern African climate. This study uses dry spell frequency (DSF) to assess spatial and temporal patterns in the consistency of rainfall during the mid-summer (DJF) season and their relationships to interannual drought occurrences in southern Africa. The Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) pentad data are used to identify dry spells, which are defined here as a pentad with mean daily rainfall less than 1 mm. It was found that DSFs over most of southern Africa are highest (lowest) during El Ni{\~n}o (La Ni{\~n}a) events and that their occurrence is associated with shifts in the location of the tropical-temperate-trough (TTT) systems that are the dominant rain-producing systems over much of southern Africa. The latter are tropical-extratropical cloudbands that link a tropical low over low latitude southern Africa with a westerly disturbance passing south of the landmass. A preferred zone of occurrence of high DSFs, within which the interannual range is also highest, lies across the 20 to 25{\textdegree}S band in southern Africa and is identified as the drought corridor. This region often experiences half or more of the season under dry spells. In addition, a tendency during 1979 to 2002 towards an increasing frequency of heavier rainfall events was observed over Angola/Namibia in the west and Tanzania/Mozambique in the east. Only a small area in central southern Africa showed the reverse tendency.},

The study focuses on four subregions (Western and Central Sahel, Sudanian zone and Guinea Coast). Defining wet (dry) spells as sequences of consecutive days with precipitation higher (lower) than 1 mm, we describe the space-time variability of wet and dry spell occurrence. This climatology stresses the influence of the relief on the number and duration of these spells. The spatio-temporal variability of the wet and dry spells also appears to be closely related to the spatio-temporal variability of the West African monsoon. The number of wet spells of all durations and of 2–3 day dry spells have similar features with a maximum occurrence during the local rainy seasons and a spatial pattern similar to the mean annual rainfall with a north–south gradient. In contrast, dry spells lasting more than four days show some singularities such as a low occurrence over the Sahelian band or high occurrence along the Guinea Coast mainly from Ivory Coast to Benin. Moreover, the seasonal cycle of these longer dry spells presents higher occurrences at the beginning and the end of the rainy seasons.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: Over the twentieth century, Sahel rainfall has undergone extreme variations on a decadal timescale. This study investigated the recent precipitation changes in West African Sahel using a high-resolution Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS) product over the period 1981-2014. We found that the recent increase in precipitation results principally from an increase in the number of wet days (+10 d compared to the normal) over the entire West African Sahel band, along with an increase in the precipitation intensity over the central part of the West African Sahel (+3 mm d<sup>-1</sup>). However, this overall increase in precipitation is associated with dry spells that are becoming more frequent but on average shorter over the entire West African Sahel band (on average by 30\%), and with precipitation intensity that is decreasing (around 3 mm d<sup>-1</sup> during the study period) in the western part of the West African Sahel (Senegal). Such reorganization (i.e. weaker but more frequent precipitation) is expected to be beneficial for agriculture and society, reducing the likelihood of both flooding and droughts.},

    abstract = { This paper reviews recent literature concerning a wide range of processes through which climate change could potentially impact global-scale agricultural productivity, and presents projections of changes in relevant meteorological, hydrological and plant physiological quantities from a climate model ensemble to illustrate key areas of uncertainty. Few global-scale assessments have been carried out, and these are limited in their ability to capture the uncertainty in climate projections, and omit potentially important aspects such as extreme events and changes in pests and diseases. There is a lack of clarity on how climate change impacts on drought are best quantified from an agricultural perspective, with different metrics giving very different impressions of future risk. The dependence of some regional agriculture on remote rainfall, snowmelt and glaciers adds to the complexity. Indirect impacts via sea-level rise, storms and diseases have not been quantified. Perhaps most seriously, there is high uncertainty in the extent to which the direct effects of CO2 rise on plant physiology will interact with climate change in affecting productivity. At present, the aggregate impacts of climate change on global-scale agricultural productivity cannot be reliably quantified. }

MSWEP V2 is unique in several aspects: i) full global coverage (all land and oceans); ii) high spatial (0.1°) and temporal (3 hourly) resolution; iii) optimal merging of P estimates based on gauges [WorldClim, Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D), Global Summary of the Day (GSOD), Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC), and others], satellites [Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), Gridded Satellite (GridSat), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42RT)], and reanalyses [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) and Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55)]; iv) distributional bias corrections, mainly to improve the P frequency; v) correction of systematic terrestrial P biases using river discharge Q observations from 13,762 stations across the globe; vi) incorporation of daily observations from 76,747 gauges worldwide; and vii) correction for regional differences in gauge reporting times. MSWEP V2 compares substantially better with Stage IV gauge–radar P data than other state-of-the-art P datasets for the United States, demonstrating the effectiveness of the MSWEP V2 methodology. Global comparisons suggest that MSWEP V2 exhibits more realistic spatial patterns in mean, magnitude, and frequency. Long-term mean P estimates for the global, land, and ocean domains based on MSWEP V2 are 955, 781, and 1,025 mm yr−1, respectively. Other P datasets consistently underestimate P amounts in mountainous regions. Using MSWEP V2, P was estimated to occur 15.5\%, 12.3\%, and 16.9\% of the time on average for the global, land, and ocean domains, respectively. MSWEP V2 provides unique opportunities to explore spatiotemporal variations in P, improve our understanding of hydrological processes and their parameterization, and enhance hydrological model performance. }

journal={European Journal of Wildlife Research},
year={2015},
volume={61},

abstract={In alpine environments, snow typically reduces the accessibility of herbivores to food during winter and may hamper survival in those species with poor adaptation to move in deep snow. Supplemental feeding systems compensate for food limitation, but modify resource distribution and potentially affect individual space use. We investigated the importance of snow cover and supplemental feeding in shaping winter habitat use and selection of the European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), a small deer species not specifically adapted to snow. We applied a used/available experimental design to assess the effects of snow cover on roe deer distribution at a fine scale and compared this approach with remotely sensed satellite data, available at moderate spatial resolution (snow MODIS). Based on this, we developed a resource selection function. We found a strong selection for habitat spots covered by forest where snow sinking depth was less pronounced, likely providing thermal and hiding protection on the one side and minimising the effect of snow on locomotion on the other. Roe deer showed only a minor preference for sites in proximity to feeding stations, possibly compensating the costs of access to these sites by means of a 'trail-making' behaviour. Snow cover assessed by moderate resolution satellite was not proportional to roe deer probability of use, highlighting the importance of local information on snow quality and distribution to complement remotely sensed data.},
